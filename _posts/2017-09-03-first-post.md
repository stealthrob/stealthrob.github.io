Hi! this is my first post using jekyll, think it is great. Although I haven´t finished to understand it, it seems like a great framework to blog. I love its integration with GitHub, I think that if you have some familiarity with git Jekyll is a great option to have a post, and if you are not already familiar with git, ¡This is a great way to begin to lear git !

This week I found a really good channel about programming that you may like. I will leave the first video about his Functional Programming series:

Hope I can write a post every week and little by little be constructing this site.
