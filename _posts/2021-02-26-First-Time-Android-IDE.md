This is the first post I make using my phone to write it. IÂ´m using a Samsung 10+ and Samsung Dex to transform my phone into a terminal where I can code. It is incredible what you can do using Samsung Dex. From my point of view, Samsung continues bringing value and innovation to the smartphone space.
