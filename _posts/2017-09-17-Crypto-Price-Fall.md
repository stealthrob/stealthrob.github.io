I am new to writing posts but I thought it would be a good idea to share some of the things I am passionate about and maybe someone is founds interesting reading the post.

I am a blockchain believer, I see blockchain technology changing the way many types of transactions are done. From sending 'remittances' or 'remesas' like we call in MÃ©xico, to the way companies ensure big supplies of raw material. There are big companies investing in blockchain technology like [Santander](http://www.expansion.com/empresas/banca/2017/02/28/58b5c923468aeb3d7d8b466b.html) or [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/) so I think this technology is here to stay and disrupt fields as finance. But last month the cryptocurrencies suffered a low in their prices due to some factors like the statements of the CEO of JP Morgan Jamie Dimon trying to undermine the strength of the Cryptocurrencies (some people compared his statements with the statements of a cab driver speaking of UBER) and some regulations of Chinese government to the crypto environment. I think the suddenly drop of the prices of cryptocurrencies is due to the youth of the market so this may be a good opportunity to buy some crypto and wait to the prices go up.

I think blockchain technology is here to stay but there is a long way to go before it is adopted for the majority of the people, like the internet. So, in its growth wait for many volatility.
