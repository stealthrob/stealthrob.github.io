Welcome to my personal website, in this place I want to share the world some about who I am and also it would be fantastic if this blog could be useful to someone.

I am a Mexican Computer Systems Engineering Student, currently intern at IBM where IÂ´m learning more about Cloud Development and Cognitive Systems.
