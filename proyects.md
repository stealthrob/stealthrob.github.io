Hi, I will be showing some projects I have been working on.

1. Node.js Application with IBM Watson.

	This is the project I´m currently working at my internship. I am developing a Node.js application that uses Watson API´s to enhance it. 
	The application is hosted in Bluemix, the IBM´s cloud. I am using various cool features developed by IBM like the tools of the [Garage Method](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/). 

2. Robotino FESTO
	
	[Robotino](http://www.festo-didactic.com/int-en/services/robotino/?fbid=aW50LmVuLjU1Ny4xNy4zNC4xMTY4) is a robot developed by FESTO. The project I participated was the logistics challenge in which the objective was to simulate a production chain. Here I practiced Java programming.
