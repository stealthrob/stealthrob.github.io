Hi, I will be showing some projects I have been working on.

1. Node.js Application with IBM Watson.

	A fun and exciting internship project developed using Node.js to consume Watson API and enable a chatbot that helped Support Engineers to access information faster. The app was hosted in Bluemix (the previous name for IBM Cloud). I had the opportunity to play with some DevOps tools from the [Garage Method](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/)  to achieve Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. 

2. Robotino FESTO
	
	[Robotino](http://www.festo-didactic.com/int-en/services/robotino/?fbid=aW50LmVuLjU1Ny4xNy4zNC4xMTY4) is a robot developed by FESTO. The project I participated was the logistics challenge in which the objective was to simulate a production chain. Here I practiced Java programming.

3. Websites

	I have developed various websites using WordPress here I leave a link to some of them:
