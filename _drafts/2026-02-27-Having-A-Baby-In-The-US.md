There are experiences in life that completely change the way you see the world. Having a baby is one of them. I want to share some thoughts about what it has been like to have a baby in the United States, far from family, and what the first months of parenthood have taught me.

## The hospital experience

The American healthcare system is something you never fully understand until you have to navigate it for something this important.

## The first months

Nothing prepares you for the first months. The sleep deprivation, the learning curve, the overwhelming love.

## Being far from family

This is probably the hardest part of being an immigrant parent. In Mexico, family is everything. When a baby is born, the grandparents, the aunts, the cousins, everyone shows up. Here in Atlanta, it is different. You learn to build your own support system, but there are moments when you really miss having your family close.
